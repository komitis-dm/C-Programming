# C-Programming

Code completed on the grounds of the Procedural Programming course in the University of Macedonia. This repository features **Projects** that needed to be completed throughout the semester, featuring increasingly more complicated yet basic concepts of C, as well as **Tests** which were personal projects created in order to get a better understanding of the given material. The Project titled "Christmas Bazzar" is the final assessment that had to be completed during this course.
